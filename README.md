Some experiments with outer-extreme-points (*CHIM<sub>+<sub>* bounds) injection based EMO (Evolutionary Multi-objective Optimization) algorithm. This experiment has two parts --

1. onsga2r: The *CHIM<sub>+<sub>* bounds injection based on NSGA-II. See [here](https://github.com/chudur-budur/oemo/blob/master/onsga2r/README.md) for details how to compile and run an experiment.

2. omoead: This part is the *CHIM<sub>+<sub>* bounds injection based on MOEAD. This part is based on the [jMetal](https://github.com/jMetal) library.
