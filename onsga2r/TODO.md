#### Paper is almost ready except the moea/d results --
1. make the nadir estimation code independent from the actual nsga2 code
2. convert the nadir estimation code in such a way that it can be called
independently and will store all the approximated nadir solutions in one 
file for each problem. i.e. zdt1.nadir.in
3. clean up the code.
