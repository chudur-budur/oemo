#### Paper is almost ready except the moea/d results --
1. ~~make the nadir estimation code independent from the actual nsga2 code~~
2. ~~convert the nadir estimation code in such a way that it can be called independently and will store all the approximated nadir solutions in one file for each problem.~~
3. clean up the code.
4. re-run the experiments and prepare results.
5. do the MOEA/D experiments.
