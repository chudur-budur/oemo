TODO
====

#### Issue 1:
* ~~fix makefile (changing header does not recompile the source)~~
* ~~implement rga~~
* ~~do euclidean dist in crowd_dist (done, slightly better in 3 obj)~~
* ~~fix the extreme point update with weak domination (just apply non-dominated sort on E)~~

#### Issue 2:
* ~~change rng call to make identical initial pop~~
* replace rga with fmincon
* merge 3 way plots -- nsga2+extreme, onsga2, nsga2+no-extreme + FE eval to find extremes
* ~~rewrite scripts in python, numpy and matplotlib~~
* change the nsga2r/onsga2r and scripts in such a way that they can be run in parallel
* clean up code, lots of unused functions and also needs some code optimization.
* compare with reference HV measure, to compute the reference HV use the ideal front from ETHZurich's site.
