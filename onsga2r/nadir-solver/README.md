This folder contains the MATLAB (`R2014a`) codes to find the approximated *CHIM<sub>+<sub>* bounds.
All the *CHIM<sub>+<sub>* bounding solutions are saved in the `../nadirs` folder.

1. `gen_nadir.m`: the main executable script, read this file to understand how this works.

2. `test_antenna.m`: the script to run and test the multi-objective circular antenna array problem solver.
